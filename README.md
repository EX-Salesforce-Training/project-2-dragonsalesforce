Fantasy Real Estate
Project Description
  An experience cloud site using the Salesforce platform which allows users view, post, and submit offers
  on properties from fantasy domiciles in popular books/movies/tv shows/video games. 
  Users can also select the name of a property of interest from a combobox to display important property info
  (Address, Region, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Asking Price) As well as pick any of the URL Images associated with the
  property and view it in a larger format.
  Users are able to post their own property to the site as an opportunity, through LDS, containing all of the relevant 
  information, when that opportunity is approved, it will be shown in the filter and display area of the experience cloud site,
  with a button click, the user can switch from a submission form to a datatable view that shows all opportunities the
  user has created.
  Lastly, the user can submit an offer on a property, using LDS again, and click a button to switch to another Datatable
  view, which will display all offers the user has made.
  
  Some business processes included but not shown on the experience cloud site:
  When a property's bidding status becomes "Closed Sold," an archive property record is created using the property details,
  the property is deleted, and the realtor earns commission based on a percentage of the accepted bid.

Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

-Users can use a filter function to limit the properties returned by Asking Price, Bedrooms, Bathrooms and Region.
-Users can also select the name of a property of interest from a combobox to display important property info
  (Address, Region, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Asking Price) As well as pick any of the URL Images associated with the
  property and view it in a larger format.
-Users are able to post their own property to the site as an opportunity, through LDS, containing all of the relevant 
  information, when that opportunity is approved, it will be shown in the filter and display area of the experience cloud site,
  with a button click, the user can switch from a submission form to a datatable view that shows all opportunities the
  user has created.
 -The user can submit an offer on a property, using LDS again, and click a button to switch to another Datatable
  view, which will display all offers the user has made.

To-do list:
- The experience cloud site should be accessible to end-users, not only the org administrator. 
  Security changes should be made so portal users can view object records when logged in.
- A new filter should be implemented to allow a user to view offers that have been made on properties they submitted.
